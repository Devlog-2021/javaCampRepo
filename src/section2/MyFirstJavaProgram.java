		 /**     rob.penDown();    **/

        // SPEED. Make the robot move quickly. Use this command:
		  /**     rob.setSpeed();    **/
 
    	// COUNT. Create an int variable that will count how many sides of the square we have drawn.
    	//        The start value will be zero because no sides have yet been drawn. Use this code:
		  /**     int count = 0;    **/
    	

        // DRAW.  Draw a line. Use this command:
    		  /**     rob.move();    **/
  

	// TURN.  Turn 90 degrees. Use this command:
    		  /**     rob.turn();    **/

    	
    	// INCREASE COUNT. Add one to the number of sides that have now been drawn like this:
    		  /**     count += 1;    **/

    	//        so it is between the curly braces like the example below. 
    	//        The code in the loop will now repeat 4 times to draw a square.

    	 *            TURN
